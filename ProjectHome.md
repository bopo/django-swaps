Swaps is a social application that allows users of a Django site to trade anything for anything with each other.

It is a Django reusable app, initially created for [Pinax](http://pinaxproject.com), but also includable in any other Django project.

You could think of it as a much simpler version of [SwapTree](http://www.swaptree.com/), although it was not copied from Swaptree.

You can download it [here](http://code.google.com/p/django-swaps/source/checkout), or it is also included in the Pinax complete\_project which you can download [here](http://pinaxproject.com/download/).

You can see it working now in [Cloud27](http://cloud27.com), a Pinax demonstration social network site, and soon in [Stray-Hound](http://stray-hound.com), a new music fan site.

You can find some documentation [here](http://code.google.com/p/django-swaps/source/browse/#svn/trunk/django-swaps/docs).
